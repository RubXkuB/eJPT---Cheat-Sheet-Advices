Who am I?
I am Network & System Engineer, for almost 20 years and I always been "cyber-security enthusiast", I am doing myself CTFs, and TOP 1% on TryHackMe 
[https://tryhackme.com/p/rubixrub]

However, I can say that cybersecurity is accessible for ALL, from scratch - you just have to take the right way and to know where to learn solid basics.
I am confident that for a real beginner (from zero) , that INE learning path is one of the best first step. 
You don't need any prerequisites, only one thing : motivation (based on enthusiasm)


I have hear about the eJPT through David Bombal, ITProTV (Daniel Lowrie) and  Network Chuck's channels on Youtube! 
Many thanks to them for the work their provide every single day and the motivation they give to all the cybersec community!

I highly recommand them , do not hesitate to have a look on them and to suscribe.
Here a link to their feedback about the eJPT exam:

Duration of exam : 72h (pratical exploitation + send the report before 72h after you have launched the exam)
NO PREREQUISITES
Exam cost : 200$
Format : 20 questions covering the pratical lab exam, open book, you can't answer if you haven't pwned the lab.
To be awarded the certification, you need to score a 75% or above (andwser 15 question correctly)


eJPT(V1) & Me:
I have scored 95% and have taken the exam in around 12h with some long breaks and double (triple) checked all answers before sending.
In few words : I have taken all my time - without any stress.

So here are my advices before taking & during the exam:
1- Take the PTS learning path (free!) and DO understand all basics and take ALL THE LABS.
# The Preliminary Skills & Programming path is an "extra skill" , you can skip it (i mean for the exam), but you will lose a lot!
2- Read the letter of engagement 
3- Read the letter of engagement (I mean read it x2!)
4- Do recon, mapping, discovery, and when you are stuck, recon and gather informations further angain and again!
5- Read ALL the questions before beginning, sometimes questions can give you some clues.
6- Don't take it as as CTF because it is NOT a challenge, but as a REAL WORLD SCENARIO!
7- If you are stuck, have a break, take a step back, and take the problem as a whole and a have bigger picture of the situation.
8- Have fun with it (yes really!)
9- Don't stress, if you fail, you can still have a second attempt!

Technical advices:

As you will notice, I will not leak anything from the exam, but I can still give you some technical advices in general regarding this exam.

-Pivoting and port forwarding :
It is a must-to-learn! You have to take care of it.

-Traffic sniffing : 
Be sure to know how to read a wireshark session!

-Recon :
You have to master nmap.
Labs are your friends!
Discover the network(s), it (/their) host(s) and identify potential surfaces of attack.
Use nmap script to gather deeper info about open ports, services running on hosts , versions, and potential vulnerabilities (cf: cheat sheet)
All techniques of exploitations will come to you in an obvious way if you identify correctly the vulnerabilities!

- I have encounter a problem with a software, giving to me a part of result but failed to extract the most important part - solution : Update it!

- If you use Kali of else on a VM, have a snapshot of your virtual machine before beginning.

- Take some notes and screenshots of everything you at every step.

- Don't lose yourself. 
If you are lost , as I told you at the beginning, have bigger picture of the situation, read the letter of the engagement again, read the questions again.
You will determine what is the scope / objective and what is expected from you :)

- Act as professional, track all what you do, SAVE all your notes at each step, so you can retrieve them in case of power cut or any bug.
