Who am I?
I am Network & System Engineer, for almost 20 years and I always been "cyber-security enthusiast", I am doing myself CTFs, and TOP 1% on TryHackMe 
[https://tryhackme.com/p/rubixrub]

However, I can say that cybersecurity is accessible for ALL, from scratch - you just have to take the right way, where to learn solid basics.
I am confident that for a real beginner (from zero) , that INE learning path is one of the best first step. 
You don't need any prerequisites, only one thing : motivation (based on enthusiasm)
